### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Used the-new-css-reset by Elad (https://github.com/elad2412/the-new-css-reset)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I reviewed:
How to use well HTML Semantic elements (<main>)
Various ways of centering including CSS Flex and Grid but I chose to go with flex.
And the use of "max-width" for responsiveness

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  padding-inline: 1rem;
}
```

### Useful resources

- (https://austingil.com/px-or-rem-in-css/#:~:text=Pixels%20are%20an%20absolute%20unit,the%20equivalent%20of%2024%20pixels.) - This helped me to choose rem over px for responsiveness. I will use it going forward
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e0wuvhxLk4&ab_channel=DaniKrossing) - This is a video which helped me to understand why we need to reset our CSS.
