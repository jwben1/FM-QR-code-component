### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Used the-new-css-reset by Elad (https://github.com/elad2412/the-new-css-reset)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I reviewed:
- How to use well HTML Semantic elements like main 
- Various ways of centering including CSS Flex and Grid but I chose to go with flex.
- The use of "max-width" for responsiveness.
    
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  padding-inline: 1rem;
}
```

### Useful resources

- (https://austingil.com/px-or-rem-in-css/#:~:text=Pixels%20are%20an%20absolute%20unit,the%20equivalent%20of%2024%20pixels.) - This helped me to choose rem over px for responsiveness. I will use it going forward
